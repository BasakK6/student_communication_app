# student_communication_app

This project is the companion project of the ["Develop Apps with Flutter"](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/dijitalatolye/course/develop-app-flutter) course provided by Google Digital Garage. 
The course language is Turkish. Below is the content of the course. 
In this project, some of the concepts that are thought in the course were applied. 
Fake exceptions were also created programmatically in order to learn how to handle exceptions.

   - Using Packages
2. Object Oriented Programming with Dart
   - Classes (Encapsulation and private fields)
   - References
   - Immutable objects and final keyword
   - Class constructors (initializer list, named constructors)
   - Properties (get/set)
   - Inheritance
   - Generics
3. Collections
   - iterable, list, map and set (+looping over collections)
   - Collection operators (using if and for inside collections)
   - Collection methods (map(), any(), where(), fold())
4. Introduction to Flutter

7. Layout
   - Layout algorithm
   - Layout widgets (single child layout widgets and multi-child layout widgets)

   - Adaptive layouts (LayoutBuilder, MediaQuery)
   - Using image and video assets
8. Navigation
   - Push, pop
   - Sending data to new route and receiving data back
   - WillPopScope, maybePop
   - Using Named Routes
9. Asynchronous Programming
   - Using asynchronous functions
   - Future Objects
   - Async/await keywords
10. Widgets in Flutter
    - SafeArea, Scaffold, AppBar, BottomAppBar, Drawer, BottomNavigationBar, BottomSheet
    - Center, Align, SizedBox, Padding, Container, DecoratedBox, SingleChildScrollView, PhysicalModel, FractionallySizedBox, ClipRRect
    - ListView, Table, PageView
    - Text, RichText, Image, ImageProviders (AssetImage, NetworkImage..), Named Image constructors(Image.asset()..)
    - CheckBox, Switch, Radio, DropdownButton, Slider, TextField
    - Form, TextFormField and DropdownButtonFormField (validator and onSaved properties), Form Validation, Form Saving
    - Transform, FittedBox, FractionallySizedBox, RotatedBox
11. State Management with Riverpod
    - Provider types (Provider, StateProvider, StateNotifierProvider, ChangeNotifierProvider, FutureProvider, StreamProvider)
    - AsyncValue
    - Consumer, ConsumerWidget, ConsumerStatefulWidget
    - WidgetRef and watch/read/listen/refresh methods
    - autoDispose, family modifiers
12. Using Internet and Network Requests
    - http protocol and API’s
    - JSON
    - Model Classes
    - API services
    - Making network requests with http package
13. Exception Handling
    - Different exception/error sources (compile time errors, runtime errors, Flutter layout errors, Internet connection errors, server side errors, errors caused by the received data from the server such as unexpected data content..)
    - Try/catch/finally
    - Returning a widget with FutureBuilder’s snapshot.connectionState.hasError
    - Returning a widget with AsyncValue.when
    - Showing SnackBar, Dialog when there is an error, logging, trying the operation again
    - Future.catchError()
14. Firebase
    - Authentication, Firestore DB, Realtime DB, Storage
    - How to setup a firebase Project and configure the app
    - Email and Google Sign-in

    - Explicit Animations
    - Rive.app and Lottie animations
16. Tests
    - Unit Tests (test(), group(), setUp(), tearDown(), expect())
    - WidgetTests (WidgetTester, pumpWidget(), find(), enterText(), tap(), pump(), pumpAndSettle())
    - Integration Tests (integration_test package)
17. Preparing to release the app
    - Difference between debug build and release build
    - Apk, appBundle, ipa files
    - Setting the app icon with flutter_launcher_icons
    - App singing in Android and iOS
